Problem: Longest Consecutive Sequence
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-consecutive-sequence/description/

Given an array of integers nums, return the length of the longest consecutive sequence of elements that can be formed.
A consecutive sequence is a sequence where each element is exactly one greater than the previous element.
Elements do not appear consecutively in the original array.

You must write an algorithm that runs in O(n) time.

Example 1:
Input: nums=[2,20,4,10,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest consecutive sequence is [2,3,4,5].

Example 2:
Input: nums=[0,3,2,5,4,6,1,1]
Output: 7
