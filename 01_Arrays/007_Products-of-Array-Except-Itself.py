Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/product-of-array-except-itself/description/

Given an integer array nums, return an array output where output[i] is the product of all the elements of nums except nums[i].
Each product fits in a 32-bit integer.
Follow-up: Solve in O(n) time without using division.

Example 1:
Input: nums=[1,2,4,6]
Output: [48,24,12,8]

Example 2:
Input: nums=[-1,0,1,2,3]
Output: [0,-6,0,0,0]

Constraints: 
2<=nums.length<=1000
-20<=nums[i]<=20
