Problem: Encode and Decode Strings
Link: https://leetcode.com/problems/encode-and-decode-strings/description/

Design an algorithm to encode a list of strings to a single string. The encoded string is sent over the network and decoded back to the original list of strings.

Implement the encode and decode methods:

Example 1:
Input: dummy_input=["Hello","World"]
Output: ["Hello", "World"]

Example 2:
Input: dummy_input=[""]
Output: ['']

Constraints:
0<=str.length<=100
0<=strs[i].length<200
strs[i] contains any possible characters out of 256 Valid ASCII characters.

Follow-up: Your solution should work for any possible set of characters.
