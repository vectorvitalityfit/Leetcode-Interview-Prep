# Leetcode-Interview-Prep

## Overview
This repository contains my solutions to  the **Blind 75 LeetCode** problems, a curated list of coding challenges commonly asked in technical interviews. This goal is to strengthen problem-solving skills and prepare effectively for software engineering interviews.

## Purpose
- Practice and master essential data structures and algorithms using **python**
- Build a strong foundation for technical interviews.
- Showcase coding skills and problem-solving approach.

## Repo Structure
- `01_Arrays/` - Solutions to array-related problems.
- `02_LinkedLists/` - Solutions to linked list problems.
- `03_Trees/` - Solutions to tree and binary tree problems.
- `04_Graphs/` - Solutions to graph problems.
- `05_DynamicProgramming/` - Solutions to dynamic programming problems.
- `06_TwoPointers/` - Solutions to two pointers technique problems.
- `07_Heaps/` - Solutions involving heaps and priority queues.
- `08_StacksQueues/` - Solutions involving stacks and queues.
- `09_BinarySearch/` - Solutions involving binary search.
- `10_Backtracking/` - Solutions involving backtracking.
- `11_Others/` - Miscellaneous problems and topics.

Each folder contains Python files named with the problem number and title, for example:
`001_Contains-Duplicate.py`

Each solution file includes:
- Problem description (linked to the LeetCode problem)
- Well-commented Python code
- Brief explanation of the approach

## How to Use
- Clone the repo to your local machine.
- Navigate folders by topic.
- Open and run Python files to review and test solutions.

## Skills Practiced
- Arrays, Strings, Linked Lists
- Trees, Graphs, Heaps
- Dynamic Programming
- Two Pointers, Sliding Window
- Backtracking and more
